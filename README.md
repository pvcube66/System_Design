System Design Learning Journal
Welcome! 👋
This repository documents my daily progress as I dive deep into the world of system design and related concepts like Low Level Design (LLD), High Level Design (HLD), and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).

🚀 About This Repo
Purpose:
To serve as a personal journal and knowledge base of what I learn each day about designing scalable, maintainable software systems.

Content:

Notes on LLD, HLD, DSA, and system design principles

Study guides, flashcards, and practice questions

Sample designs and code snippets

Reflections and challenges I encounter

📚 What You'll Find Here
LLD (Low Level Design):
Learn how to structure code using object-oriented principles, focusing on entities, relations, maintainability, scalability, and reusability.

HLD (High Level Design):
Explore system architecture topics including tech stacks, database choices, server scaling, and cost optimization.

DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms):
Practice core algorithmic problem-solving skills that power efficient software.

System Design Best Practices:
Insights on data security, modularity, code reusability, and debugging techniques.

📝 How to Use This Repo
Browse notes and study materials in the relevant folders (e.g., /lld/, /hld/, /dsa/)

Try out flashcards and practice questions to reinforce key concepts

Use sample designs as templates for your own projects

🌱 Current Focus
I'm currently focusing on these areas:

Building maintainable and scalable application skeletons using LLD

Understanding the interplay between HLD, LLD, and DSA in real projects

Applying OOP principles to practical system problems

🔖 Essential Definitions
LLD: Defines code structure (classes, relations, reusability)

HLD: Deals with overall system architecture

DSA: Focuses on algorithms and problem-solving

💡 Practice & Reflection
Feel free to use the practice questions or add your own! Collaboration and learning together are welcome.

📅 Progress Tracking
Daily entries record what I learn, what I build, and challenges I overcome.
Check the commit history or the /journal/ folder for my regular updates.

Thanks for stopping by!
Let’s build great systems, one concept at a time. 🚀
